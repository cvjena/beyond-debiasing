This repository includes a Python implementation of the hybrid CMI estimator CMIh presented by [Zan et al.](https://doi.org/10.3390/e24091234) The authors' original R implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/leizan/CMIh2022). CMIh was published under the MIT license.

## Installation
First, you have to install ACD as described in the [Repository for "Hierarchical interpretations for neural network predictions" by Singh et al.](https://github.com/csinva/hierarchical-dnn-interpretations)
